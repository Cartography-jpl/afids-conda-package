  summary: This is a metapackage that installs the tools to build geocal or afids
  description: |
    This has everything needed to build afids or geocal, along with a few
    other useful tools (e.g. opencv). It does not contain geocal, so if
    you are interested in building afids only you may want to also install
    the geocal conda package.
